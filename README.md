# Tensorflow basic examples

This repository contains some machine learning solution implemented with
tensorflow in python.

### Table of contents
| | Source | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | 
|1| **[Perceptron Regressor](linear_regression.py)** | Build a linear regressor model using perceptron.
|2| **[Single Layer Neural Network](single_layer.py)** | Create a single layer neural network. Using it to build an image classifier working on MNIST.
|3| **[Convolutional Neural Network](cnn.py)** | Using a basic CNN architecture to gain more accuracy on MNIST.

## Prerequisites
If you have problem installing tensorflow-gpu on a machine with a Debian based operating system [this](https://medium.com/repro-repo/install-cuda-and-cudnn-for-tensorflow-gpu-on-ubuntu-79306e4ac04e) post helps you a lot.
